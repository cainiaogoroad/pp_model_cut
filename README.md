# Zero Bubble Replication on MLORA/Pipeline

This repository aims to replicate the **Zero Bubble** technique based on the **MLORA/Pipeline** framework. The project explores innovative methods to improve model performance by leveraging the MLORA architecture and advanced data processing pipelines.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

The **Zero Bubble** technique is an advanced method that minimizes performance gaps in machine learning models. By utilizing **MLORA/Pipeline** as the foundational framework, this repository focuses on:
- Implementing core components of the Zero Bubble technique.
- Testing and optimizing the pipeline for seamless integration.
- Achieving reproducible and reliable results.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

- **`src/`**: Source code for the MLORA/Pipeline-based Zero Bubble implementation.
- **`data/`**: Contains datasets or pointers to the datasets used in experiments.
- **`scripts/`**: Helper scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- **`notebooks/`**: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and prototyping.
- **`tests/`**: Unit tests to ensure code reliability and correctness.
